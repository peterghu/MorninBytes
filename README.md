MorninBytes is an efficiency-boosting desktop program designed to make morning routines more efficient. I found that I was opening the same websites/programs and doing the same tasks regularly for my morning routine, and wanted a tool that could automate it so most of that routine could be setup to be consumed visually with a few clicks. Particularly this will help with the forced shutdowns from Windows updates.

Made with WPF, MahApps, and C#, .NET 4.6.1 in Visual Studio 2017.

Simply add the websites you want to open (your system's current default browser will be used), set a second delay for how quick to open them, and click on the load button! Website lists are saved in XML files, see attached "settings.xml" file for an example.
